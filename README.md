==============

* Compile main by   "gcc main.c -o main" 
* Compile sim       "gcc sim.c -o sim"
* Run main and sim in seperate consoles.
* The simulation will start when both programs are ready.
 (main can be used with argument "-d" to bypass the menu.)
* Currently the program turns on and off a random device each tick.
* A tick adds 60 mins to the timer.
